codechef
========

a collection of AC submitted algorithms and code for the online programming competition platform "Codechef" - Codes are uploaded only when the respective competitions containing the problems are officially marked 'ended'. This collection is made to personally track my competitive programming performance. If interested please evaluate my code; tips to help me improve on the algorithms and suggestions regarding how to code the solutions better are extremely welcome.

In this life journey, I fancy being able to solve programming problems.
